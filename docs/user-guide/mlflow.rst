Introduction
============

`MLFlow <https://www.mlflow.org/>`_ is a platform to streamline machine learning (ML) development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

MLFlow integration with Kubeflow on vSphere requires a relation between MLFlow and `MinIO <https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/index.html>`_ operator, which you learn more in this section. MinIO is used to store artifacts produced by MLFlow runs (files, models, images, in-memory objects, model summary, etc). In the last part of this section, you learn how to access the artifact store using MinIO client or ``boto3`` APIs.

For the basic knowledge, please refer to `mlfow-quick-start <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html#downloading-the-quickstart>`_ and to understand how it works, please refer to its `source code <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow>`_. 

Get started
===========

Deploy mlflow-server and mlflow-db
----------------------------------

This section guides you through the integration of MLFlow with Kubeflow on vSphere using `Juju <https://juju.is/>`_. This integration enables true automated model lifecycle management using MLFlow metrics and the MLFlow model registry.

In an Ubuntu terminal window, run the following commands to deploy ``mlflow-server`` and ``mlflow-db``:

.. code-block:: shell

    juju deploy mlflow-server
    juju deploy charmed-osm-mariadb-k8s mlflow-db


For ``mlflow-server`` to become active, you need to integrate applications that have been deployed with these commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    juju relate minio mlflow-server
    juju relate istio-pilot mlflow-server
    juju relate mlflow-db mlflow-server
    juju relate mlflow-server admission-webhook


Run ``watch juju status`` to watch the application status of ``mlflow-db`` to become active and ``mlflow-server`` to be waiting for ``mysql`` relation data. This takes about a minute.


Run an example model with Kubeflow on vSphere
-----------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    *Temporary workaround for missing pod-defaults*

    Run the following command to make a copy of pod defaults to the userâ€™s namespace ``admin``:

    ``k8s kubectl get poddefaults mlflow-server-minio -o yaml -n kubeflow | sed 's/namespace: kubeflow/namespace: admin/' | k8s kubectl create -f -``


Create a new Notebook server refer to :ref:`user-guide-notebooks`, taking care to specify the ``mlflow-server-minio`` configuration, by ticking the box next to it. This ensures that the correct environment variables are set so that the MLFlow SDK can connect to the MLFlow server.

For an example code, upload or paste the `Elastic Net wine model notebook <https://github.com/canonical/mlflow-operator/blob/main/examples/elastic_net_wine_model.ipynb>`_ to the Notebook server.

Run the first two cells and observe that your model metrics are recorded in MLFlow as shown in the cell output below. You can see the ``RMSE``, ``MAE``, and ``R2`` for the run model.

Run the third cell to view a list of files in the object storage.

In the last cell, replace ``<minio file path>`` with the path of the file you want to download. Use the object path listed in the output of the previous cell, and replace ``<notebook server file path>`` with the desired destination file for the downloaded object.

For example, to download ``requirements.txt`` listed in the above screenshot, run ``object_storage.download_file(default_bucket_name,'0/10e3bd4d7edd4b879b239a96cb300d48/artifacts/model/requirements.txt','requirements.txt')``

The downloaded object will show up in the file browser on the left.
