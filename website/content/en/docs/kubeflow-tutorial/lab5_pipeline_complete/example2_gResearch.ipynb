The Kubeflow Pipelines SDK makes it easier to build lightweight Python function-based components by saving the effort of creating a component specification. Python function-based components make it easier to build pipeline components by building the component specification for you. Python function-based components also handle the complexity of passing inputs into your component and passing your function’s outputs back to your pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through this concrete example to understand above ideas better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the overall workflow follows from original model itself. So please do not freak out when you see long, heavy code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the following modifications were required to the original function.\n",
    "- The import statements were moved inside of the function. Python function-based components require standalone Python functions. This means that any required import statements must be defined within the function, and any helper functions must be defined within the function. \n",
    "- The function’s arguments all include `data_path` which specifies the location for data storage, and also accessing. This lets Kubeflow Pipelines know the where to extract the data in zipped tar file into, where your function stores the processed data or model, and where to access it and use it as inputs for components.\n"
