## About Kubeflow
---
#### **What is Kubeflow?** ####
Kubeflow is a free and open-source platform for machine learning on Kubernetes. The Kubeflow project has multiple distinct software components which each address specific stages of the machine learning lifecycle, including model development, model training, model serving, and automated machine learning. Each component of Kubeflow can be deployed separately, and it is not a requirement to deploy every component.

The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. It provides a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow. Kubeflow is supported by the biggest names in tech, receiving over 1000 contributions from companies like Google, AWS, Microsoft, VMware, Red Hat, Bloomberg, Cisco, IBM and Intel.

#### **Features** ####
Kubeflow includes services to create and manage ***interactive Jupyter notebooks***. You can customize your notebook deployment and your compute resources to suit your data science needs. Experiment with your workflows locally, then deploy them to a cloud when you're ready. 

Kubeflow provides a custom ***TensorFlow*** training job operator that you can use to train your ML model. In particular, Kubeflow's job operator can handle distributed TensorFlow training jobs. Configure the training controller to use CPUs or GPUs and to suit various cluster sizes. 

Kubeflow supports a TensorFlow Serving container to export trained TensorFlow ***models*** to Kubernetes. Kubeflow is also integrated with Seldon Core, an open source platform for deploying machine learning models on Kubernetes, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for maximized GPU utilization when deploying ML/DL models at scale, and MLRun Serving, an open-source serverless framework for deployment and monitoring of real-time ML/DL pipelines. 

Kubeflow ***Pipelines*** is a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing end-to-end ML workflows. Use Kubeflow Pipelines for rapid and reliable experimentation. You can schedule and compare runs, and examine detailed reports on each run. 

In addition, Kubeflow is also working hard to extend the support of ***PyTorch, Apache MXNet, MPI, XGBoost, Chainer, and more***. It also integrates with ***Istio and Ambassador*** for ingress, ***Nuclio*** as a fast multi-purpose serverless framework, and ***Pachyderm*** for managing your data science pipelines. 

Kubeflow community is an open and welcoming community of software developers, data scientists, and organizations. Feel free to join its Slack Workspace!
