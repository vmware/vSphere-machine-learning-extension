# HanLP: Han Language Processing

The multilingual NLP library for researchers and companies, built on PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.x, for advancing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in both academia and industry. HanLP was designed from day one to be efficient, user friendly and extendable. It comes with pretrained models for various human languages including English, Chinese, Japanese and many others.

HanLP offers out-of-the-box RESTful API and native Python API which share very similar interfaces while they are designed for different scenes.

This tutorial shows you its APIs with a Jupyter notebook.

Steps to run the example:

1. Create a new notebook server on **Kubeflow on vSphere** dashboard with 2 CPUs and 4G RAM using custom Docker image `projects.registry.vmware.com/models/notebook/inference:nlp-pytorch-cpu-v3`. GPU is not needed. 

2. `CONNECT` to the notebook server and launch a Terminal in the created notebook server.

3. Download the Jupyter notebook in the Terminal via command: 

   ```shell
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware/vSphere-machine-learning-extension/master/examples/model_serving/nlp/hanlp/HanLP.ipynb
   ```

4. Open the downloaded notebook and run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the results.
